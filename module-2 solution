		<h3 id="box2">Beef</h3>
	<p>
		Beef is meat from a cow. It's also a word for a complaint. The word beef comes from the Old French word buef, which became the word for basically, cow meat. Beef is to cow as pork is to pig or mutton is to sheep. On the other hand, if you have a beef with someone, you have a complaint.
